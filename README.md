# django project CoreySchafer
## Hi
#### This repository was created for the step-by-step tutorials I took during the [CoreySchafer](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer) Django course.
###### After downloading this project, it is better to install the libraries mentioned in the ***requirements.txt*** file. To install them together, you can use the ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` command in your system Command Prompt.
